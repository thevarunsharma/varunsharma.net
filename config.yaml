  text: |
    I'm Creative Director and UI/UX Designer from Sydney, Australia, working in web development and print media.
    I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

    My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive.
    Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way. I created web design for many famous brand companies.

      - Working with the Edge Infrastructure team, responsible for managing LinkedIn's Edge Network which involves services like DNS, CDNs, Azure Front Door, TLS certificates and related tools.
      - Developed an AI-based tool capable of intelligently orchestrating the Edge (AFD, PoPs, CDNs) on the DNS layer for optimal end-user availability. This completely automated the mundane task of manual fail-overs, cutting down on several man hours.
      - Worked on migrating site-traffic from LinkedIn's legacy Edge on to Azure Front Door. Responsible for setting up Azure Front Door and DNS ramp for the migration.
      - Worked closely with Microsoft Azure counterparts to help them recognise and solve ongoing issues with their AFD platform as it pertains to LinkedIn. Worked on devising a Proof of Concept for performing Automated Root Cause Analysis of such issues.
      - Introduced manifold improvements to LinkedIn's url short-link feature - lnkd.in - by aligning stakeholders to remove extra redirect and by onboarding it to AFD with Caching at the Edge.
